        Parameters
        ----------
        catchment_shp: string or Path
            path and filename for shapefile with catchments

            with right format to be cast as a pathlib.Path()

        catch_idx: string
            name of column used to set_index for
            geodataframe of catchments. Defaults to None which
            gives sequential indexing from shapefile.

        stream_idx: string
            name of column used to set_index for
            geodataframe of streamlines. Defaults to None which
            gives sequential indexing from shapefile.

        Attributes
        ----------
        catchment_df: geopandas DataFrame
            dataframe of catchment polygons

        streamline_df: geopandas DataFrame
            dataframe of stream lines

        Methods
        -------
        get_home(self, Well or lat/long): returns geopandas dataframe
             polygon for catchment containing a passed Well object, geopandas
             dataframe, or (lat/long) location - usually called by get_geometries

        get_neighbors(self, Well or lat/long or gpd): returns geopandas dataframe
             of polygons for catchments neighboring a home catchment given
             either a geopandas dataframe with the home catchment, a Well
             object, an (lat/long) location - usually called by get_geometries

        get_geometries(self, gpd): returns two geopandas dataframes

            The first has streamlines
            contained in the home+neighbors.

            The second has the location of the closest point
            for the stream in each catchment and the well, finally the
            inverse-distance and inverse-distance-squared apportionment
